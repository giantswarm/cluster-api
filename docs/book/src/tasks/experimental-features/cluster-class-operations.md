# Clusterclass operations
Clusterclass and managed topologies can be used to control a number of advanced behaviors in Cluster API. 

##  Changing a ClusterClass
When you change a ClusterClass, the system validates the required changes according to the [compatibility rules defined in the ClusterClass proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/202105256-cluster-class-and-managed-topologies.md#clusterclass-compatibility).

According to [Cluster API operational practices](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/updating-machine-templates.html), the recommended way for updating templates is by template rotation (create a new template, update the template reference in the ClusterClass, and then delete the old template).

<h1>Warning</h1>

Changing a ClusterClass triggers changes on all the Clusters using the ClusterClass.

</aside>

If changes are evaluated as potentially leading to a non-functional Cluster, the operation is rejected. It is important to note that the current implementation ensures only a minimal set of compatibility rules are applied; most importantly, there are no provider specific rules at present, so you should refer to the provider documentation for preventing potentially dangerous changes on your infrastructure.


Once the changes are applied, the topology controller reacts as described in the following table.

Note: In case a provider supports in place template mutations, the Cluster API topology controller will adapt to them at the next reconciliation, but the system is not watching for those specific changes. When the underlying template is updated in this way the changes may not be reflected immediately, but will be put in place at the next full reconciliation. The maximum time for the next reconciliation to take place is related to the CAPI controller sync period - 10 minutes by default.
